NNFS Non Networked File System

The documentation is in "doc/nnfs.html"

COMPILING
---------
---------

To compile nnfs2
	cd src
	./configure
	make clean
	make
	cp nnfs2 /usr/local/bin

If you want to compile rootnnfs2 (UID/GID mirroring)
	cd src
	./configure
	make clean
	make rootnnfs
	cp rootnnfs2 /usr/local/bin

TESTING
---------
---------

Not useful for Linux/x86 because it was tested for years.
For other system I will be happy to have feedback.

To test nnfs2 as a normal user.
	cd tst
	./tests
If you know the root password, you can run some more test.
I think it is not a good idea for you to use these tests.
	tests root

  TODO

It works perfectly for me and I am tired of this program.
I think I will no more work on NNFS,
so if somebody else want to take the flame.

QUESTIONS:
	- Add a filter for file to historize?
	- Add a filter for file to read?
	- Add option TMP_FILE=file name?
