      <H1>NNFS (Non-Networked File System)</H1>


    <H2>The goal</H2>
    <p>
      NNFS provide a consistent file system over several
      non networked <b>UNIX</b> computers (or slow networked).
      For example on your computer at home and at work
      using only a floppy disk for the synchronisation.

    <H2>The NNFS advantages</H2>
    <UL>
      <LI> You are sure to work on the latest version of files.
      <LI> You don't need to remember which files are modified on
	an host and must be transfered on others.
      <LI> You don't need to made backup, because if a computer crash
	the file system is still on the other computers working with NNFS.
      <LI> The NNFS medium is choosen by a user shell script,
	it could be: floppy disk, usb key, serial connection, ...
      <LI> Minimal NNFS medium bandwidth to make the updates.
      <LI> EASY TO USE: Running ``nnfs'' command before and after your work.
      <LI> Numbered backup of files modified/deleted on NNFS.
      <LI> If you modify the same file on several hosts
	NNFS solves the update conflict.
      <LI> The program has been hugely tested.

      This version of NNFS compile and run on:
    <UL>
      <LI> Linux (Debian): compiled, tested and used for years
      <LI> HPUX 10.20: compiled and tested
      <LI> IRIX: compiled and tested
      <LI> Mac OS X: compiled, problems remaining :
		<UL>
		<LI> Mac OS X doesn't store the modification date
			    of symbolics links.
                <LI> for Mac OS X, "README" and "Readme" are
			      the same file. So there is
			      mirroring problems between Mac
			      and other Unixes.
